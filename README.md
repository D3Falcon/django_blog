# django_blog
Welcome to my blog-like web application built using the Django framework in Python!

Please note that this application was created for studying the framework and has been developed following this series of videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p. You may notice that my implementation differs slightly from what is shown in the videos. Furthermore, I plan to add more features in the near future, so this is not the final version.

If you would like to run this app, you can either download the files or clone the repository using Git. The requirements are Python 3 and Django 4.2.1.

Thank you for checking out this project.
